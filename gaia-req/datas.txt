Rahul Shanmugam S has always been passionate about driving, but his approach has evolved significantly over the past 12 years. As an experienced driver, Rahul understands the nuances of the road, from managing smooth braking to maintaining consistent speed control. His Tesla Model 3, a 2022 edition, has been his reliable companion, seamlessly integrating AI assistance and blockchain-based automation to make every drive efficient and eco-friendly.

Rahul’s daily routine revolves around efficiency. With an average weekly mileage of 350 miles, he ensures that his vehicle is always charged and ready. Unlike traditional fuel stops, Rahul’s Tesla is plugged into his home charging station every night, maintaining a steady battery efficiency of 4.5 miles per kWh. He also strategically plans his charging sessions to take advantage of off-peak electricity rates, further optimizing his energy consumption. Recently, he redeemed 10 carbon credits for an EV charging discount, a small but impactful step towards sustainable driving.

Despite his careful driving habits, Rahul had a minor accident in 2021. It was a low-impact collision at a busy intersection. Fortunately, his Tesla’s AI-powered insurance automation kicked in immediately, logging the incident on the blockchain and triggering an automatic claim submission. Within three hours, the case was processed, and he received the necessary coverage, eliminating the usual hassles of insurance paperwork. Since then, Rahul has been extra cautious on the road, reinforcing his commitment to smooth driving and minimal harsh acceleration.

His dedication to eco-driving is reflected in his impressive score of 87/100. Rahul takes pride in his ability to balance speed and energy efficiency. He frequently uses the Tesla’s AI-assisted predictive route planning to avoid congested areas, reducing unnecessary stops and optimizing his driving patterns. His efforts have paid off—his vehicle’s carbon footprint is 18% lower than comparable gas-powered cars, earning him 140 carbon tokens to date. By trading or redeeming these credits, Rahul not only contributes to a greener environment but also enjoys financial savings, projected at $240 per year in energy credits.

Routine maintenance is another aspect Rahul takes seriously. His last check-up was in December 2024, ensuring that his Tesla remains in peak condition. With an AI-powered predictive maintenance system, he receives alerts well in advance of potential issues, allowing him to address them before they escalate. This has significantly reduced unexpected breakdowns and enhanced the vehicle’s longevity.

Rahul’s insurance premium is dynamically adjusted based on his driving habits. Thanks to his eco-friendly and safe driving record, he has earned a 5% discount on his annual premium, bringing it down to $800 per year. The smart contract-linked insurance system continuously evaluates his driving behavior, making real-time adjustments to reward responsible drivers like him.

Beyond the personal benefits, Rahul’s vehicle is part of a larger, decentralized network that contributes to smarter transportation solutions. His Tesla is integrated with Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum) blockchain, ensuring that his driving data remains secure and transparent. The on-chain system records key metrics such as mileage, energy consumption, and accident history, providing valuable insights that help improve urban mobility planning.

Looking ahead, Rahul is excited about the future enhancements of his vehicle. With decentralized AI training, his Tesla will continue to learn and personalize its driving style to match his preferences. Real-time traffic optimization and vehicle-to-vehicle communication will further refine his driving experience, making every journey smoother and more efficient. As he drives into the future, Rahul remains committed to leveraging technology for a safer, greener, and smarter mobility ecosystem.
