# Running the Agents

Follow these steps to set up and run the agents:

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dumprahul/PiETHon
cd arbitrum-agents
```

## 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Check if Gaia Works
If Gaia works, you're good to go! Start the application by running:
```bash
npm run start
```

## 4. If not works
If Gaia doesn‚Äôt work, you‚Äôll need to comment out the OpenAI-related code in the createAssistants.ts file.
Locate the OpenAI code inside createAssistants.ts and comment it out to bypass it temporarily.
Then run it.

```bash
npm run start
```
